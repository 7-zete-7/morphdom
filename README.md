morphdom
========

_NOTE: This module is experimental, but seems to work in the latest browsers (including IE9+). Use at own risk!_

Simple module for morphing an existing DOM node tree to match a target DOM node tree. It's fast and works with the real DOMâ€”no virtual DOM here!

This module was created to solve the problem of updating the DOM in response to a UI component or page being rerendered. One way to update the DOM is to simply toss away the existing DOM tree and replace it with a new DOM tree (e.g. `myContainer.innerHTML = newHTML`). While replacing an existing DOM tree with an entirely new DOM tree will actually be very fast, it comes with a cost. The cost is that all of the internal state associated with the existing DOM nodes (scroll positions, input caret positions, CSS transition states, etc.) will be lost. Instead of replacing the existing DOM tree with a new DOM tree we want to _transform_ the existing DOM tree to match the new DOM tree while minimizing the number of changes to the existing DOM tree. This is exactly what the `morphdom` module does! Give it an existing DOM node tree and a target DOM node tree and it will efficiently transform the existing DOM node tree to exactly match the target DOM node tree with the minimum amount of changes.

`morphdom` does not rely on any virtual DOM abstractions. Because `morphdom` is using the _real_ DOM, the DOM that the web browser is maintaining will always be the source of truth. Even if you have code that manually manipulates the DOM things will still work as expected. In addition, `morphdom` can be used with any templating language that produces an HTML string.

The transformation is done in a single pass and is designed to minimize changes to the DOM while still ensuring that the morphed DOM exactly matches the target DOM. In addition, the algorithm used by this module will automatically match up elements that have corresponding IDs and that are found in both the original and target DOM tree.

# Usage

```javascript
var morphdom = require('morphdom');

var el1 = document.createElement('div');
el1.className = 'foo';

var el2 = document.createElement('div');
el2.className = 'bar';

morphdom(el1, '<div class="bar"></div>');

expect(el1.className).to.equal('bar');
```

You can also pass in an HTML string for the second argument:

```javascript
var morphdom = require('morphdom');

var el1 = document.createElement('div');
el1.className = 'foo';

morphdom(el1, '<div class="bar"></div>');

expect(el1.className).to.equal('bar');
```

NOTE: This module will modify both the original and target DOM node tree during the transformation. It is assumed that the target DOM node tree will be discarded after the original DOM node tree is morphed.

# FAQ

## Isn't the DOM slow?

No, the DOM _data structure_ is not slow. The DOM is a key part of any web browser so it must be fast. Walking a DOM tree and reading the attributes on DOM nodes is _not_ slow. However, if you attempt to read a computed property on a DOM node that requires a relayout of the page then _that_ will be slow. However, `morphdom` only cares about the following properties of a DOM node:

- `el.firstChild`
- `el.tagName`
- `el.nextSibling`
- `el.attributes`

## What about the virtual DOM?

Libraries such as a [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) and [virtual-dom](https://github.com/Matt-Esch/virtual-dom) solve a similar problem using a _Virtual DOM_. That is, at any given time there will be the _real_ DOM (that the browser rendered) and a lightweight and persistent copy of the real DOM tree that mimics the real DOM. Whenever the view needs to update, a new _virtual_ DOM tree is rendered. The new virtual DOM tree is then compared with the old virtual DOM tree using a diffing algorithm. Based on the differences that are found, the _real_ DOM is then "patched" to match the new virtual DOM tree and the new virtual DOM tree is persisted for future diffing.


Both `morphdom` and virtual DOM based solutions update the _real_ DOM with the minimum number of changes. The only difference is in how the differences are determined.

There are some drawbacks to using a virtual DOM-based approach:

- The real DOM is not the source of truth (the persistent virtual DOM tree is the source of truth)
- The real DOM cannot be modified behind the scenes (e.g., no jQuery) because the diff is done against the virtual DOM tree
- The virtual DOM is an abstraction layer that introduces code overhead
- The virtual DOM is not a standard (only the DOM is a standard)
- The virtual DOM can only be used with templating languages that produce a virtual DOM tree

The premise for using a virtual DOM is that the DOM is "slow". While there is slightly more overhead in creating actual DOM nodes instead of lightweight virtual DOM nodes, we are not seeing any noticeable slowness in our benchmarks. In addition, as web browsers get faster the DOM data structure will also likely continue to get faster so there benefits to avoiding the abstraction layer. We have benchmarks that you can test for yourself:



## Which is better: rendering to an HTML string or rendering virtual DOM nodes?

There are many high performance templating engines that stream out HTML strings with no intermediate virtual DOM nodes being produced. On the server, rendering directly to an HTML string will _always_ be faster than rendering virtual DOM nodes (that then get serialized to an HTML string). In a benchmark where we compared server-side rendering for [Marko](https://github.com/marko-js/marko) (with [Marko Widgets](https://github.com/marko-js/marko-widgets)) and React we found that Marko was able to render pages ten times faster than React with much lower CPU usage (see: [Marko vs React: Performance Benchmark](https://github.com/patrick-steele-idem/marko-vs-react))

In theory, Marko could support two compiled outputs: one that produces HTML strings and another that produces DOM nodes.

# API

## morphdom(fromNode, toNode, options) : Node

The `morphdom(fromNode, toNode, options)` function supports the following arguments:

- *fromNode* (`Node`)- The node to morph
- *toNode* (`Node`) - The node that the `fromNode` should be morphed to
- *options* (`Object`) - See below for supported options

The returned value will typically be the `fromNode`. However, in situations where the `fromNode` is not compatible with the `toNode` (either different node type or different tag name) then a different DOM node will be returned.

Supported options (all optional):

- *onNodeDiscarded* (`Function(node)`) - A function that will called when a `Node` in the `from` tree has been discarded and will no longer exist in the final DOM tree.
- *onBeforeMorphEl* (`Function(fromEl, toEl)`) - A function that will called when a `HTMLElement` in the `from` tree is about to be morphed. If the listener function returns `false` then the element will be skipped.
- *onBeforeMorphElChildren* (`Function(fromEl, toEl)`) - A function that will called when the children of an `HTMLElement` in the `from` tree are about to be morphed. If the listener function returns `false` then the child nodes will be skipped.

```javascript
var morphdom = require('morphdom');
var morphedNode = morphdom(fromNode, toNode, options);
```
