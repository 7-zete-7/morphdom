morphdom
========

_NOTE: This module is experimental, but seems to work in the latest browsers. Use at own risk!_

Simple module for morphing an existing DOM node tree to match a target DOM node tree. It's fast and works with the real DOMâ€”no virtual DOM here!

The transformation is done in a single pass and is designed to minimize changes to the DOM while still ensuring that the morphed DOM exactly matches the target DOM. In addition, the algorithm used by this module will automatically match up elements that have corresponding IDs and that are found in both the original and target DOM tree.

NOTE: This module will modify both the original and target DOM node tree during the transformation. It is assumed that the target DOM node tree will be discarded after the original DOM node tree is morphed.

# Usage

```javascript
var morphdom = require('morphdom');

var el1 = document.createElement('div');
el1.className = 'foo';

var el2 = document.createElement('div');
el2.className = 'bar';

morphdom(el1, el2);

expect(el1.className).to.equal('bar');
```
